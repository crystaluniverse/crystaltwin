# Lets create a simple Blog Scenario where there exist Users, Posts and Comments
#
# First we define 4 classes to represent our Model: User, Content, Post < Content & Comment < Content
#

class User
  getter :id, :first_name, :last_name, :role
  def initialize(@id : String, @first_name : String, @last_name : String, @role : UserRole); end
end

abstract class Content
           #
           # due to https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/4580
           # we have to include the ObjectType module at the first definition of Content
           # in order for the field macro to work on child classes. Once this is fixed the
           # arbitrary classes can declared as GraphQL Object types easily via monkey Patching
           include ::GraphQL::ObjectType
           @id: String
           @body: String
           @author: User
           def initialize(@id, @body, @author); end
         end

class Post < Content
  getter :id, :author, :title, :body
  def initialize(@id : String, @author : User, @title : String, @body : String); end
end

class Comment < Content
  getter :id, :author, :post, :body
  def initialize(@id : String, @author : User, @post : Post, @body : String); end

# and create some fixtures to work with
